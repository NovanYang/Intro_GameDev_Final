Use mouse left click to interact, the green UI on the bottom right is the energy bar and the red UI above is the hp of the player,
the player can use card to cast spell and each card use different energy:

the fireball cost 2 energy and deals 3 damages,
the frost cost 3 energy and deals 2 damages to all enemies,
the knife cost 1 energy and deals 1 damage,

energy will be refilled after each round, after player's round would be enemies's round, each enemy will attack the player.

I think I finish the mod with a decent level and there are still a lot of improvement can be made, all the indications of different
action can be clearer and there can be more special effect with different spell.
